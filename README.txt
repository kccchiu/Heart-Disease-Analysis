code_pdf_format display the ipython notebook in a pdf file. 
I put all my code in CS235PythonAnalysis.ipynb. Comments are added to the code
The heart.csv needs to be in the same directory as the ipython notebook in order for the code to run.
The dataset is relatively small, so the run time would not be too long.
Thank you.
